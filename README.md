## Inspiration

When taking notes on a video (on a small screen), I often find myself switching between two tabs, which means that I miss half the video, or squinting to see the video when using a split screen. Both of these are not efficient methods, and I often have to rewind the video to find the answer to the question I missed. So, I decided to create VidNotes, an innovative new way to take notes. VidNotes lets you overlay your notes on top of a video, which allows you to see both at the same time.

## What it does

VidNotes is a website that lets you take notes on a video more efficiently. Simply enter the link of a youtube video, and you'll be able to take notes on the video while seeing both your notes and the video. VidNotes provides a semitransparent overlay where you take notes, and because it's semitransparent, you'll still be able to see the video.

VidNotes is also very customizable; you can change the opacity of the overlay to your liking and choose the color of the overlay.
